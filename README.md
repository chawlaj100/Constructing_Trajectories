# Constructing_Trajectories
The project is about calculating vehicle positions and constructing their trajectories/paths based on data from its sensors. 

We basically generate data similar to as generated by the original sensors in a vehicle.
Here we have 4 columns namely:
1. Time
2. Displacement
3. Yaw
4. Acceleration

According to calculus we know that
Integrals:
v(speed) = a * dt (a -> acceleration)
s(displacement) = v * dt (v -> velocity/speed)

Derivatives:
a(acceleration) = dv/dt (dv -> change in velocity/speed)
v(speed) = ds/dt (ds -> change in distance/displacement)

We will use these operations for calculating the required quantities.

Start looking at the project from Reconstructing Trajectories ipython notebook.
Clone the repo and run the ipython notebooks to get a better understanding.
